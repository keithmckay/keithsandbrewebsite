                    We we're offically married on December 3rd 2020 and postponed our ceremony to November 12th 2021 due to Covid. 
                    Our ceremony was at the Wedgewood in Black Forrest and we had the time of our lives with friends and family.

                We've been together for many years and lived in a few different places over that time. 
                We started off small, living at the base of the mountains in a little camper. Then we bought our first townhouse, which we now rent out. 
                Recently we bought another home with a huge backyard for our dogs to play in.

                In 2018 we brought home our first dog, Iroh. He is named after Uncle Iroh in our favorite cartoon - Avatar: The Last Airbender.
                He is surprisingly patient, although he can get a little grumpy. In 2020 we brought home Toph, who is the athlete of the house, 
                constantly running, jumping, fetching, biting and keeping us all on our toes.
